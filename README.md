# SSMSpine
**SSMSpine** dataset comprises a total of **12,500** synthetic yet realistic mid-sagittal lumbar spine MR images. Each MRI is annotated with the identification of five lumbar discs **(D1, D2, D3, D4, D5)** and six vertebral bones **(L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, S1)**.SSMSpine provides not just annotated segmentation masks but also includes landmark coordinates, offering valuable information for diverse medical image analysis tasks.

Image size is **512 × 512**, and the intensity of each image is normalized to fall within the range **[0,1]**. The dataset also include **intensity corrected image**, **intensity equalized image**, **pixel label map**, **binary masks**, **landmark points coordinates** for each subject in images. There are **236** shape landmark points for each vertebra bone, and **176** shape landmark points for each lumbar disc.

The SSMSpine dataset is synthesized using a combination of a statistical shape model (SSM) and biomechanics, which serves as a special way of de-identifying patient image data. For details of the generation process, please refer to our paper ***[Evaluation of Deep Neural Network Models for Instance Segmentation of Lumbar Spine MRI](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.02.587810v1)***.

Kindly be aware that the SSMSpine dataset is exclusively intended for research purposes.
